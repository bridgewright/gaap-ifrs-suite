r"""Frontmatter stripping and section splitting for K-IFRS standard documents.

KASB-published K-IFRS PDFs/HWPs bundle FOUR kinds of material in one file:

1. Cover page + bilingual (Korean/English) IFRS Foundation copyright notice +
   table of contents ("목차") -- administrative front matter, never citable body
   text, and a source of false paragraph-boundary matches (bare TOC numbers like
   a lone "22" or address fragments like "7 Westferry Circus...").
2. 본문 -- the main numbered paragraphs (digit numbering: 1, 2, 5.5.1, 40G, plus
   the Korea-only "한2.1" insert-paragraph convention KASB adds into the IFRS
   translation).
3. 부록 A/B/C 적용지침 -- appendices (defined terms, application guidance,
   effective date & transition). Letter-prefixed numbering: A1, B1, C1, C1A.
   "이 부록은 이 기준서의 일부를 구성한다" -- same authority as the main body,
   so this is corpus-depth in scope and retained.
4. 결론도출근거 (Basis for Conclusions, "BC...") and 적용사례*실무적용지침
   (Illustrative Examples, "IE...") -- both explicitly say of themselves "이
   기준서를 구성하지는 않는다" (does not form part of the standard). Dropped.

Both functions below are anchor-based: they search for byte-stable KASB/IFRS
Foundation template phrases rather than doing exact byte-diffing or relying on
page numbers, so the same logic works across both the PDF extraction (one text
line per *visual* line, heavy wrapping) and the HWP extraction (one text line
per logical paragraph, no wrapping, occasionally missing the space after a
paragraph number) despite their very different line-shapes.

GENERALIZATION NOTES (63-standard full-set pass):

* PDF line-wrapping can split an anchor phrase mid-word at an unpredictable
  character offset. Many K-IFRS PDFs render Korean prose with NO inter-word
  spaces at all (a font/extraction characteristic of these particular PDFs,
  out of scope to "fix" here -- extract.py is not touched), so there is no
  natural break point and PyMuPDF's visual-line-wrap newline can land between
  ANY two characters of a multi-syllable anchor word. Confirmed empirically:
  the self-description sentence "...로 구성되어 있다" wraps as "...로구\n성되어있다"
  in 1103, "...로 구성\n되어 있다" in 1113, and "...구성되\n어 있다" in 1032 --
  three DIFFERENT split points for the same 4-syllable word. `_loose()` below
  builds a regex tolerating an optional line-wrap between every character of
  an anchor word so this is no longer a per-standard game of whack-a-mole.
* The old TOC-closing anchor (`구성되어\s*있다|부여되어\s*있다`) was searched
  UNBOUNDED from the end of the copyright block to the end of the document.
  Combined with the mid-word-wrap problem above, this was catastrophic: for
  1032/1103/1113 the near-front, legitimate occurrence of the sentence was
  wrap-split and so invisible to the old regex, and the search then matched
  some UNRELATED later use of "구성되어 있다"/"부여되어 있다" as ordinary
  Korean phrasing deep inside 결론도출근거/적용사례 (e.g. 1032's real hit was
  at char 117,941 of a 126,296-char document) -- which then became the cut
  point, discarding the entire real 본문/적용지침/부록 as "frontmatter". The
  fix has two parts: (a) require the anchor to be self-referential --
  "기업회계기준(해석)?서 제NNNN호"-style, immediately followed (within a
  short span) by "구성"/"부여" -- which a random BC/IE sentence never is, and
  (b) even so, bound the whole search to `_TOC_SCAN_BOUND` characters past the
  copyright block. Bounding means a miss now degrades to "some TOC residue
  survives into 본문" (a MINOR, gate-catchable defect) instead of "the entire
  body is gone" (CRITICAL). Every legitimate near-front gap measured across
  all 63 real standards is <=2,922 chars; every pathological deep/BC-side
  match measured is >=15,000 chars -- `_TOC_SCAN_BOUND` sits well inside that
  gap.
* 해석서 (interpretations) use a structurally different template from 기준서:
  no "구성되어 있다." sentence in isolation -- instead "...으로 구성되어
  있으며, 결론도출근거가 첨부되어 있다." (a connective "-며" clause, not a
  full stop) or even "...으로 구성되며" (no 있다/있으며 at all). The
  self-ref+"구성" anchor (deliberately not requiring any particular verb
  ending) covers both.
* 개념체계 and both 번역서 (non-mandatory translated guidance, no 제NNNN호
  number) have NO self-referential "구성되어 있다"-style sentence anywhere
  near the front at all -- so the primary anchor legitimately does not fire
  for them. All three DO carry a "[기타 참고사항]" (or "기타 참고사항:")
  bracket/label that is the last piece of TOC preview content before the real
  title repeats, so `_KICHA_RE` is used as the fallback anchor. Confirmed
  present, close to the copyright block, in all 63 standards (max legitimate
  gap 2,825 chars, for the largest document, 1109).
* Appendix ("부록") headings are punctuated inconsistently: "부록 A. 용어의
  정의" (letter + period + title, same line -- 1103/1113/1111 style), "부록
  A\n현재가치기법을 사용한 사용가치 측정" (letter, NO period, title on the
  NEXT line -- 1036/2120/2121/2122 style), "부록 적용지침" (no letter at all,
  title same line -- 1032 style), "부록. 적용지침" (no letter, period, title
  same line, no-space PDF -- 2116 style), "부록\n용어의 정의" (no letter, no
  punctuation, title on next line -- 개념체계/번역서-경영진설명서/
  번역서-중요성판단 style). Rather than enumerate punctuation variants,
  `_find_appendix_heads()` anchors on the semantic CONFIRMING sentence that
  immediately follows every one of these headings in real documents -- "이
  부록은 ... 일부를 구성한다/구성하며/이다" ("this appendix forms part of
  ..."), the same sentence the module docstring above already quotes as the
  reason appendices are in-scope. This generalizes across every punctuation
  style above in one pattern instead of five. The lone exception found is
  개념체계's own glossary appendix, which has no confirming sentence at all
  (it launches straight into the glossary content) -- handled by a narrow,
  additional "부록" + nearby "용어의 정의" fallback.
* The board-resolution voting-log line was anchored on a literal
  "기업회계기준서" prefix, which never matches 해석서's "기업회계기준해석서"
  (extra "해석" infix) or 개념체계's quoted-title self-reference ("'재무보고를
  위한 개념체계'의 ... 회계기준위원회의 의결") -- so this log leaked into
  본문 for every one of the 19 해석서 and for 개념체계. Re-anchored on the
  stable suffix "...회계기준위원회의 의결" (with a short, line-scoped prefix
  budget) instead of the standard-specific prefix.

# K-GAAP (일반기업회계기준) segmentation
#
# Structurally unrelated to the K-IFRS/KASB-translation template above: K-GAAP
# is KASB's OWN native-Korean standard (no IFRS Foundation copyright block at
# all -- confirmed absent from every sampled 장/chapter and from the
# conceptual-framework document), organized by 장 (chapter) rather than by
# 기준서 number, with 본문 paragraphs numbered "<장번호>.<문단번호>" (e.g.
# "13.1", "13.45" for 제13장 '리스') instead of K-IFRS's un-prefixed
# "22"/"5.5.1"/"40G".
#
# Confirmed (2026-07-06) against 9 downloaded real 장 (1/2/3/4/6/7/8/9/10/13/
# 15/31/33 sampled directly, remainder spot-checked) plus the 3 non-chapter
# items (재무회계개념체계, 일반기업회계기준 시행일 및 경과규정,
# 보험업회계처리준칙):
#
# * TITLE BLOCK: every 장 opens with a 4-line block -- "일반기업회계기준",
#   "제N장 <제목>", "한국회계기준원 회계기준위원회", "의결 YYYY. M. D." --
#   then repeats the "제N장 <제목>" heading once more on the next (page-break-
#   separated) page before real content starts. No bare-number TOC precedes
#   this (unlike K-IFRS), so there is no paragraph-number collision risk left
#   unstripped even if the anchor below is missed; cutting past the
#   "의결 YYYY.M.D." line just removes the block for cleanliness. PDF space-
#   rendering is inconsistent even WITHIN one document (e.g. 제31장's own
#   title-block renders with no inter-word spaces at all -- "의결2020. 10.
#   16." -- while its page-2 repeat heading has normal spacing) -- confirmed
#   the same characteristic K-IFRS's PDFs have (see module docstring above)
#   -- so `_loose()` is reused here too.
# * BODY: 본문 paragraphs are numbered "<장번호>.<문단번호>" (e.g. "13.1"
#   .."13.53") for the 33 numbered 장. The non-chapter items number
#   differently: 재무회계개념체계 uses bare "N." (digit + literal period +
#   space, e.g. "2. 본개념체계는..." -- confirmed NOT to match K-IFRS's own
#   DIGIT_PARA_RE, which requires whitespace immediately after the digits
#   with no intervening period), while 시행일 및 경과규정 uses bare "N"
#   (no chapter prefix, since it is not itself a 장) and 보험업회계처리준칙
#   (a pre-2011 "종전 기업회계기준" grandfathered into the 일반기업회계기준
#   category until superseded, per its own in-document editorial note) uses
#   legacy "N. <heading>" numbering with "(N-M)" parenthesized sub-items that
#   are not separately numbered here. chunk.py's KGAAP_BODY_PARA_RE covers
#   the first three shapes with one pattern; "(N-M)" sub-items are swept up
#   as part of whichever top-level "N." paragraph precedes them (same
#   coarser-grained-but-faithful tolerance K-IFRS's own chunker already has
#   for prose subheadings sitting between two real paragraph markers).
# * APPENDIX ("부록"): a 장 that has one opens with a self-referential
#   "일반기업회계기준 제N장 '<제목>'의" line followed immediately by a bare
#   "부록" heading line, which in turn is immediately followed by ONE of up
#   to four sub-headings (order not fixed, not all always present -- e.g.
#   제31장 has only 결론도출근거, no 실무지침/적용사례; 시행일 및 경과규정's
#   own 부록 has only 소수의견):
#     - 결론도출근거 (Basis for Conclusions) -- paragraphs "결<N>.<M>".
#       SAME term K-IFRS uses for its own BC section, so the existing
#       _BC_DIVIDER_RE is reused as-is (not redefined).
#     - 실무지침 (Practical/Implementation Guidance) -- paragraphs
#       "실<N>.<M>". This is K-GAAP's 적용지침-equivalent (문단 1.2 of 제1장
#       itself describes 부록 as composed of "결론도출근거, 실무지침 및
#       적용사례"; 실무지침 is the one of the three never accompanied by
#       "이 기준의 일부를 구성하지 아니한다"-style self-disclaiming language
#       anywhere near it in any sample checked, unlike 결론도출근거/
#       적용사례/소수의견) -- kept, tagged tier="적용지침" for cross-GAAP
#       consistency with schema.TIERS (same output tier name as K-IFRS's own
#       부록 A/B/C application guidance).
#     - 적용사례 (Illustrative Examples) -- case-based, numbered "사례1",
#       "사례2" (no chapter prefix, no decimal). SAME term/divider shape
#       K-IFRS uses for its own IE section, so the existing _IE_DIVIDER_RE is
#       reused as-is. Dropped (non-authoritative, case illustrations only).
#     - 소수의견 (board member dissenting opinion, confirmed present in the
#       시행일 및 경과규정 부록) -- paragraphs "소<N>". Dropped alongside
#       결론도출근거/적용사례 (rationale/opinion commentary, not the standard
#       itself) via its own divider, routed into the same "결론도출근거"
#       bucket as a labeling convenience only (both dropped identically by
#       chunk_pages, mirroring how K-IFRS routes its own board-resolution
#       voting log into the same bucket -- see split_sections's docstring
#       above).
# * 재무회계개념체계 (conceptual framework) has NO 부록/결론도출근거/
#   실무지침/적용사례 of its own (confirmed: 0 occurrences of all four terms
#   in the full downloaded text) -- entirely "본문"-tier once its frontmatter
#   is stripped. Its own frontmatter is much larger than a 장's: a short
#   "정본"(official-text) disclaimer + a "서문"(preface) + a multi-page,
#   per-chapter-repeating mini-TOC (headed "내\n용", PDF-wrapped from "내용")
#   that closes each block with a "문단번호" column of paragraph-range
#   previews (e.g. "1-3", "4-5", ...) -- the same per-chapter-mini-TOC-repeat
#   shape K-IFRS's OWN 개념체계 has (see _CHAPTER_TOC_RE above), just headed
#   "내용" instead of "목차". Anchoring on the LAST "문단번호" occurrence
#   (bounded -- see _KGAAP_FRAMEWORK_TOC_BOUND) and sweeping to the next
#   blank line removes the disclaimer+preface+TOC in one shot, degrading to a
#   no-op (nothing dropped) for every 장, none of which contain "문단번호" at
#   all. 보험업회계처리준칙 has no "의결" title block at all (it predates
#   that convention -- "제 정 1998. 12. 10" / "개정 YYYY.M.D." instead) and
#   no "문단번호" TOC either, so BOTH anchors below legitimately no-op for
#   it: its own short KASB editorial note + enactment/amendment history block
#   is left as harmless residue attached ahead of its first real paragraph
#   (same "cosmetic, not a fidelity violation" tolerance as everywhere else
#   in this module), rather than risk a bespoke third anchor for one legacy
#   document.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Bounded the same way as K-IFRS's own _TOC_SCAN_BOUND (see above): every
# legitimate "문단번호" occurrence confirmed in the real 재무회계개념체계
# sits at <=6,200 chars from the start of the document (3 per-chapter-preview
# blocks, the last starting around char 6,100); every 장 (which never
# contains this marker at all) trivially has none within any bound. Kept far
# above the legitimate range and far below "search the whole document" to
# preserve the same never-mistake-real-content-for-frontmatter guarantee.

# 시행일 및 경과규정). Bounded for the same reason as every other anchor in

# body content.

# all -- unlike 재무회계개념체계's own "문단번호"-columned TOC, so a separate
# anchor is needed) right after the tiny title block, occasionally spanning a
# page break (confirmed: 제26장 repeats the "목   차" heading a second time
# after a "- 2 -" page-break marker, continuing the same chapter list, and
# ending with a trailing mention of "...회계기준위원회의 의결" as the TITLE of
# the enactment-log section being previewed -- exactly the shape
# _BOARD_RESOLUTION_RE exists to catch, confirmed empirically: this TOC leaked
# into a 본문 record and tripped that leak signature before this anchor was
# added). Confirmed real span in 제26장: first occurrence at char 55 (right
# after its 53-char title block), last occurrence at char 383, sweeping to
# the next blank line at char 606 -- the WHOLE 33-chapter+3-item list is
# <=560 chars end to end. Bounded well above that (a 2nd, 3rd, ... page
# repeat of the same list would still comfortably fit) and far below "search
# the whole document", same guarantee as every other anchor here.

# chapter, and its 실무지침 content is retained but stays classified as
# 본문 tier rather than 적용지침 (a documented, minor known limitation, NOT
# a fidelity violation -- nothing is dropped or leaked, see the ingestion
# report). A same-shape, unconfirmed content-based fallback (switching
# region the moment a bare "실<N>.<M>"-shaped line was seen ANYWHERE) was
# tried to recover this, but confirmed EMPIRICALLY to be unsafe: it fired
# on an incidental "실..."-shaped line inside 제18장's own (correctly
# dropped) 결론도출근거 text, misclassifying part of that BC discussion as
# kept 적용지침 -- caught by assert_no_leak's toc_heading signature, exactly
# the "unbounded reach into unrelated real content" failure mode this
# module's anchors are designed to avoid elsewhere (see e.g. _TOC_SCAN_BOUND
# above). A single missing heading in one HWP file is a smaller, safer
# thing to accept than a heuristic that can silently misclassify OTHER,
# otherwise-correct chapters, so no such fallback is used.

# CAS (中国企业会计准则 / China ASBE) segmentation
#
# Structurally unrelated to both K-IFRS's and K-GAAP's templates above: CAS
# source documents are HTML pages (trafilatura-extracted -- see
# tools/ingest/extract.py's "html" branch), one paragraph per source `<p>`/
# table-row, from two different sites (see tools/ingest/sources.py's CAS
# registry docstring for why): casc.org.cn (中国会计准则委员会, official)
# for 준칙 본문 + most 해석, and cas.xmu.edu.cn (Xiamen University mirror)
# for all 응用指南 and the remaining 해석. THREE fundamentally different
# per-file shapes, confirmed against all 95 real downloaded files
# (43 준칙 본문 incl. 기본준칙 + 32 응용지침 + 20 해석):
#
# 1. 준칙 본문 (기본준칙 + 42 구체준칙): chaptered, numbered "第<한자숫자>条"
#    (Chinese-numeral articles, e.g. "第一条".."第六十八条" for CAS21 租赁),
#    optionally grouped under "第<한자숫자>章" (chapter) and "第<한자숫자>节"
#    (section) headings -- both excluded from paragraph-boundary detection
#    below by requiring the "条" suffix specifically (a chapter/section
#    heading never ends in "条"). No appendix/BC/IE-equivalent structure
#    exists in these documents at all -- 응용指南 and 해석 are always
#    SEPARATE files/URLs from their parent 준칙's own body (unlike K-IFRS's
#    부록 A/B/C or K-GAAP's 실무지침, both embedded in the SAME PDF as 본문),
#    so there is no within-document tier split to perform here; tier is a
#    property of which FILE a given download is, decided by the caller (see
#    chunk_pages' `tier`/`para_pattern` parameters, and
#    tools/ingest/run_ingest.py's `ingest_cas`).
# 2. 응용指南 (application guidance, only 32 of the 42 구체준칙 have one --
#    e.g. 15/25/26/29/32/36/39/40/41/42 never got a separate 应用指南 of
#    their own): unchaptered prose, top-level sections numbered bare
#    "<한자숫자>、" (Chinese numeral + IDEOGRAPHIC COMMA, e.g. "一、"，"二、"，
#    no space after -- confirmed distinct from 준칙 본문's "第X条 " shape,
#    which DOES carry a real space/nbsp after "条"), with nested "（一）"
#    (parenthesized) and "1." (arabic-dot) sub-items that carry no
#    line-start numeral alone and so are swept up into their enclosing
#    "<한자숫자>、" chunk (coarser-grained-but-faithful, same tolerance
#    K-IFRS's own chunker already has for prose subheadings between two real
#    paragraph markers). One confirmed exception (CAS17 借款费用's
#    guidance): plain unstructured prose with no "<한자숫자>、" heading at
#    all -- degrades to a single unnumbered ("0") chunk, same universal
#    fallback every other GAAP's chunker already has.
# 3. 해석 (interpretations 1-20): SAME "<한자숫자>、" top-level numbering as
#    응용指南 (not article-numbered like 본문), typically closing with a
#    "<N>、生效日期" (effective-date) section. Kept as 본문 tier per the task
#    spec (해석 has the same authority as the standard it interprets) but
#    chunked with the SECTION pattern, not the article pattern -- selected
#    per-file by the caller via `para_pattern`, exactly like 응용指南.
#
# Both `strip_frontmatter_cas` and `split_sections_cas` are anchor-based,
# same discipline as every other stripper in this module: every anchor below
# is independently optional (a miss just leaves that particular piece of
# boilerplate in place as harmless residue attached to the nearest
# unnumbered "0" chunk -- never an unbounded reach into real content).
# Confirmed boilerplate shapes, by source:
#   * casc.org.cn 준칙 본문 pages: an optional bare leading "财会[YYYY]N号"-
#     style circular-number line (bracket style is NOT consistent --
#     confirmed ASCII "[ ]" in some samples, full-width "〔 〕" and small
#     tortoise-shell "﹝ ﹞" in others), then straight into 章/条 -- no
#     other frontmatter, no copyright block (this is a PRC government
#     ministry's own portal, not an IFRS-Foundation-style copyrighted
#     translation), and a STABLE trailing footer on every single page

#
# Every page shares one shape: a KrestonVN site-chrome header line, a
# duplicate "VAS NN - <title>" line, a standard title block ("CHUẨN MỰC KẾ
# TOÁN VIỆT NAM SỐ NN" / "CHUẨN MỰC SỐ NN" (VAS 29) / "HỆ THỐNG CHUẨN MỰC KẾ
# TOÁN VIỆT NAM"+"CHUẨN MỰC NN" (VAS 30) -- punctuation/wording is NOT
# consistent enough to anchor on directly), the "(Ban hành...)" Decision
# citation, then (24 of 26 files) a "QUY ĐỊNH CHUNG" heading, then đoạn 01
# itself. VAS 29 additionally prepends the FULL Decision document's own
# preamble (a "BỘ TÀI CHÍNH | CỘNG HÒA XÃ HỘI CHỦ NGHĨA VIỆT NAM" letterhead
# table, "Số: 12/2005/QĐ-BTC", "QUYẾT ĐỊNH CỦA BỘ TRƯỞNG BỘ TÀI CHÍNH", "Về
# việc ban hành và công bố...") ahead of all of the above -- this is
# boilerplate common to the whole batch-4 Decision, not the standard's own
# regulatory text, and must be dropped like every other GAAP's own
# board-resolution/copyright preamble.
#
# Rather than enumerate every one of these title-block wording variants with
# bespoke anchors (the K-IFRS/K-GAAP/CAS approach above), strip_frontmatter_vas
# anchors on the FIRST genuine đoạn marker itself (đoạn "01"/"1", found via the
# SAME paragraph-boundary detector used for chunking -- see VAS_PLAIN_PARA_RE/
# VAS_TABLE_PARA_RE/_vas_para_matches below) and cuts everything before it.
# This is simpler AND more robust than a title-block anchor: it is completely
# insensitive to exactly how the title block is worded/punctuated/line-wrapped
# (confirmed empirically safe against all 26 real files -- none of them have
# anything shaped like a real đoạn marker anywhere in their own frontmatter,
# so this can never mistake preamble text for the real body start).
#
# ĐOẠN (PARAGRAPH) NUMBERING -- two shapes, confirmed across all 26 files:
#   1. PLAIN: "01. Mục đích..." -- digits + literal "." + real same-line space
#      + body text (25 of 26 files; VAS 27 uses bare "1."/"2." instead of
#      "01."/"02." -- no zero-padding requirement either way).
#   2. TABLE: "| 01. | Mục đích... | " -- ONE file only (VAS 23) renders EVERY
#      đoạn as a 2-column HTML table row (col 1 = bare marker alone, col 2 =
#      the paragraph's own prose), which trafilatura (see extract.py's HTML
#      path) extracts as markdown-style "| a | b |" rows.
#
# THE KNOWN BUG THIS MODULE GUARDS AGAINST (the reason an earlier pass at this
# corpus was interrupted): a genuine bulleted/enumerated list EMBEDDED inside
# an ordinary paragraph -- e.g. VAS 21 đoạn 51's 19-item balance-sheet
# line-item list, or đoạn 65's own 17-item income-statement line-item list, or
# VAS 24's Phụ lục 1/2 cash-flow-statement form templates -- is ALSO rendered
# by trafilatura as pipe-delimited table rows, e.g.
# "| 1. Tiền và các khoản tương đương tiền; |  | " -- superficially identical
# to a TABLE-style đoạn marker. A prior segmenter attempt STRIPPED the pipe
# characters as a "table-row normalizer" cleanup pass BEFORE paragraph-marker
# detection ran; once stripped, "1. Tiền và các khoản..." sits at a bare line
# start indistinguishable from a real marker, so the list's 19 items were each
# mis-detected as new đoạn boundaries, corrupting đoạn 51 into 19 bogus
# fragments.
#
# THE FIX has two parts:
#   (a) VAS_TABLE_PARA_RE requires the marker's OWN table cell to contain
#       NOTHING but the bare number ("| 01. |" -- the closing "|" follows the
#       dot with only whitespace in between). A list item's number and its
#       own text sit TOGETHER in the same cell ("| 1. Tiền và các khoản
#       tương đương tiền; |" -- real prose, not a pipe, follows the dot), so
#       it never satisfies this shape. A plain-style match separately
#       requires the line to start directly with a digit (never "|"), so a
#       pipe-prefixed list row can never satisfy that shape either. Both
#       requirements are checked directly against the RAW extracted text.
#   (b) There is no separate "table-row normalizer" step at all: pipe
#       characters are left exactly as extracted in the retained, citable
#       `text` (this module's/the whole pipeline's verbatim-preservation
#       principle -- see chunk.py's Record.text docstring), for BOTH a real
#       TABLE-style marker row (VAS 23) and an embedded list/form table (VAS
#       21/24) alike. Because no normalization pass ever touches these pipes,
#       this bug class cannot recur structurally, not merely empirically --
#       there is nothing left that could ever again turn a list marker into
#       something indistinguishable from a paragraph marker.
# Confirmed empirically against all 26 real files: every real đoạn/phụ lục
# sequence recovered is exactly right (see tests/test_segment.py and this
# ingestion's own per-standard report), and neither embedded list (VAS 21)
# nor either form template (VAS 24) ever produces a false paragraph boundary.
#
# CROSS-REFERENCE LINE-WRAP FALSE POSITIVES: separately from the table/list
# issue above, a plain-style candidate can still be a false positive when a
# cross-reference like "...theo các đoạn 50 đến\n54." or "...theo đoạn\n55."
# happens to line-wrap so the referenced number lands at a line start with
# real trailing same-line space before the next real sentence -- confirmed in
# VAS 11 (both examples are real, from its own 본문). Since a genuine đoạn/
# phụ-lục sequence is confirmed STRICTLY monotonically increasing in every one
# of the 26 real files (no legitimate renumbering/restart anywhere), chunk.py's
# VAS chunker rejects any candidate marker whose captured integer does not
# exceed the previous KEPT marker's -- see chunk.py's `_vas_marks`.
#
# APPENDICES ("PHỤ LỤC"): always rendered in full uppercase, occasionally
# line-wrapped ("PHỤ\nLỤC A"), confirmed present in only 2 of the 26 files --
# distinguished from inline mixed-case prose cross-references ("...hướng dẫn
# trong Phụ lục A về việc...", never a line-start match against
# _VAS_APPENDIX_HEAD_RE below, which is deliberately case-sensitive) by that
# same all-caps convention every OTHER heading in these documents also uses
# ("QUY ĐỊNH CHUNG", "NỘI DUNG CHUẨN MỰC"):
#   * VAS 11's "PHỤ LỤC A" ("Hướng dẫn bổ sung" -- Supplementary Guidance) is
#     genuine, substantive, letter-numbered guidance ("A1." .. "A17.",
#     confirmed strictly monotonic, no cross-reference false positives),
#     directly parallel to K-IFRS's own 부록 application-guidance tier --
#     KEPT, tagged tier="적용지침".
#   * VAS 24's "PHỤ LỤC 1"/"PHỤ LỤC 2" are blank statutory cash-flow-statement
#     FORM templates (a "Chỉ tiêu/Mã số/Kỳ trước/Kỳ này" column header then
#     row after row of a line-item name + a code number + two BLANK amount
#     cells -- no đoạn-style guidance prose, no lettered paragraph markers at
#     all) -- the same shape as K-GAAP's own excluded "영문양식" registry
#     entry (a blank financial-statement FORM exhibit, "not citable paragraph
#     text" per that entry's own ingestion note). EXCLUDED here for the same
#     reason, distinguished structurally (does this appendix block contain
#     any real VAS_GUIDANCE_PARA_RE marker at all?) rather than by heading
#     text, so this generalizes to any future VAS appendix of either shape
#     without new bespoke logic. Routed into the "적용사례" bucket as a
#     labeling/bookkeeping convenience only (same convention K-GAAP's own
#     소수의견 uses for the "결론도출근거" bucket -- see split_sections_kgaap
#     above) so retained_text_for_coverage's existing SECTION_KEYS-based
#     accounting needs no VAS-specific change at all.
# No standard has both an authoritative and a disclaimed appendix (unlike
# K-IFRS's 1007), and no VAS document has anything resembling a
# 결론도출근거/적용사례(BC/IE) section separate from its numbered đoạn body --
# confirmed 0 occurrences of either term, or of any other standalone-heading
# "dropped content" shape, anywhere in the 26 real files -- VAS's own body
# freely embeds "Ví dụ:" (example:) prose inline within a numbered đoạn
# instead of factoring it into a separate non-authoritative section the way
# K-IFRS's 적용사례 does.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Trailing `\s+` (not `[ \t]+`) is deliberate and DOES cross a newline:
# confirmed real case, VAS 21 đoạn 02 -- "02." followed by a run of 13
# non-breaking-space padding characters (see normalize_nbsp_vas above; this
# is checked AFTER that normalization runs) and then a real line break before
# its own body text starts on the next line ("02. \nChuẩn mực này áp dụng...").
# A same-line-only `[ \t]+` (tried first) misses this and every marker shaped
# like it. Allowing `\s+` to cross a newline reopens the K-IFRS-style risk of
# a cross-reference number wrap (e.g. "...theo đoạn\n55.") being mistaken for
# a real marker -- confirmed real case, VAS 11's own 본문 (see module comment
# above) -- but that risk is fully absorbed by chunk.py's `_vas_marks`
# monotonic filter instead: a genuine đoạn/phụ-lục sequence is confirmed
# strictly increasing in every one of the 26 real files, so ANY
# non-increasing candidate this looser pattern turns up is safely rejected
# there without ever rejecting a real marker.

# backstop in case strip_frontmatter_vas's own value==1 anchor is ever missed

# at all, degrading strip_frontmatter_vas to a no-op -- see its own docstring).

# real đoạn's own regulatory prose), and VAS 24's own excluded Phụ lục 1/2
# cash-flow-statement form-template heading (see split_sections_vas above --
