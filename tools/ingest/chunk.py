# translation (e.g. "한2.1", "한40.1"). The decimal part is mandatory for the

# paragraph body) is never mistaken for a paragraph: real "한" paragraphs are
# always "한<N>.<M>" in every sample seen, while KASB's own footnote marker
# convention is "한<N>)" with a closing paren, not a period.
#
# Trailing `\s+` is MANDATORY (not `\s*`): a real paragraph marker in PDF text
# is always either alone on its own line (followed by a newline) or same-line
# with a real space before the body text. PDF is heavily line-wrapped (one
# text line per *visual* line, not per paragraph), so a wrapped continuation
# line can legitimately start with a bare number that is NOT a paragraph
# marker -- e.g. a transition-paragraph sentence wrapping onto a new line
# right before "2018년 12월에 공표한...", or a stray table/diagram fragment
# like "1037" in a jumbled appendix flowchart. Requiring real trailing
# whitespace is what keeps those from being mistaken for a new paragraph
# (confirmed empirically against all 3 real standards: relaxing this to `\s*`
# reproduced exactly this failure mode on 1019 PDF). HWP's dropped space after
# the number ("1이 기준서는..." instead of "1 이 기준서는...") is handled
# separately by normalize_missing_space(), applied to each region's text
# BEFORE this pattern ever sees it -- so by the time it runs, both formats
# look the same (number, then real whitespace, then body).
#
# Trailing letters allow up to two (`[A-Z]{0,2}`, not `[A-Z]?`): amendments
# inserted after a lettered paragraph stack further letters, e.g. 1116's
# COVID rent-concession amendments produced "C20BA", "C20BB", "C20BC" as
# three distinct paragraphs (confirmed in the real 1116 PDF/HWP) on top of
# the plain single-letter "100~102A"/"40G" style seen elsewhere.

# Matches a paragraph-number marker sitting at the start of a block (start of
# the region's text, or right after a blank line) that is NOT followed by any
# whitespace at all -- i.e. exactly HWP's missing-space bug. Only fires at a
# block start (never mid-paragraph, never at a plain PDF line-wrap), and only
# when whitespace is well and truly absent (a lookahead, so an already-correct
# "22 text" or "22\ntext" is left untouched) -- so it is safe to run
# unconditionally on both PDF- and HWP-sourced region text.
#
# The integer part is capped at 3 digits (\d{1,3}, not \d+) because HWP can
# fuse the paragraph number directly onto body text that ALSO starts with
# digits, with no separator anywhere to find -- confirmed in 1019 HWP, whose
# transition-paragraph "179" runs straight into the calendar year it
# discusses: "1792018년 12월에 공표한...". An unbounded \d+ would greedily
# swallow "1792018" as one number; real paragraph numbers in these standards
# never reach 4 digits (K-IFRS standards top out at a few hundred paragraphs
# even in 결론도출근거, let alone 본문/적용지침), so capping at 3 correctly
# splits "179" from "2018" while still matching every real paragraph number
# observed (max 3 digits, e.g. "179").
# The whole alternation is wrapped in an atomic group `(?>...)`: without it,
# Python's greedy backtracking defeats the point -- e.g. matching "22 리스..."
# would first try the full "22", find the trailing lookahead fails (a real
# space already follows, so no fix is needed), and then, wrongly, backtrack
# down to matching just "2" so the lookahead can succeed against the *second*
# "2" instead. An atomic group forbids that backtrack: once the alternation
# commits to the longest possible number, it either satisfies the lookahead
# as-is or the whole match attempt fails at this position (which is exactly
# what "no fix needed here" should mean).
# Blank-line detection tolerates a "blank" line that is not perfectly empty
# but contains only spaces/tabs (`\n[ \t]*\n` instead of a strict `\n\n+`) --
# confirmed necessary against the real K-GAAP 제9장 HWP (its own attachment
# is the one K-GAAP chapter needing an HWP fallback -- see sources.py): a
# "blank" line between two real paragraphs there is literally "\n \n" (a
# single stray space character on its own line), which the original
# `\n\n+` (strictly CONSECUTIVE newlines, nothing between them) never
# matched, so the block-start check silently never fired for the paragraph
# right after it. Still matches a truly empty "\n\n" identically (`[ \t]*`
# allows zero chars), so every existing K-IFRS case is unaffected.
#
# The alternation also gains two K-GAAP-specific shapes (harmless no-ops for
# every other GAAP, whose paragraph numbers never start with "실" or take
# the "<N>.<LETTER><M>" form): "실<N>.<M>" (실무지침, K-GAAP's
# 적용지침-equivalent tier -- confirmed missing its space in the same real
# 제9장 HWP, e.g. "실9.1조인트벤처가...") and "<N>.<LETTER><M>[의<M>]"
# (적용보충기준, e.g. "6.A1"/"6.A1의2" -- see KGAAP_BODY_PARA_RE). The
# letter-suffixed shape is placed BEFORE the generic bare-digit alternative:
# since Python tries alternatives left-to-right and commits to the FIRST one
# that succeeds (not the longest), the generic `\d{1,3}[A-Z]{0,2}(?:\.\d+)*`
# would otherwise match just the leading "6" of "6.A1" (a shorter, WRONG,
# but still "successful" match: `[A-Z]{0,2}` finds no letter immediately
# after the digit run since a "." comes next, and `(?:\.\d+)*` cannot
# consume ".A1" either since a letter follows the dot, not a digit) instead
# of ever trying the more specific alternative at all -- same ordering
# discipline `KGAAP_BODY_PARA_RE` already documents.

    themselves that they do not form part of the standard. 본문 and 적용지침
    (부록 A/B/C: defined terms, application guidance, effective date &
    transition) are retained -- corpus depth per the approved spec.

    `tier` is kept for backward compatibility: when the document shows no
    recognizable section structure at all (no 부록/결론도출근거/적용사례
    heading found -- e.g. a small plain-text fixture with only digit
    paragraphs), the caller's `tier` is used for that lone region instead of
    hardcoding "본문", exactly matching the pre-existing behavior of simple
    callers. Whenever real structure IS found, tier is derived per-region
    (본문 vs 적용지침), since a single caller-supplied tier can no longer
    describe a whole multi-section document correctly.

    `para_pattern` overrides the 본문 region's paragraph regex only (적용지침
    always uses the letter-prefixed/실-prefixed pattern -- there is no legacy
    caller that ever needed to override that; CAS's own `ingest_cas` uses
    this same override to select 준칙 본문's article numbering vs 응용指南/
    해석's section numbering per FILE -- see below).

    K-GAAP (일반기업회계기준) has a document structure unrelated to K-IFRS's
    (organized by 장/chapter with "<장번호>.<문단번호>" paragraph numbering,
    no IFRS Foundation copyright block at all -- see
    tools/ingest/segment.py's K-GAAP module comment), so it is routed through
    its OWN frontmatter-stripper/section-splitter/paragraph-regex pair below
    rather than reusing the K-IFRS ones. CAS (中国企业会计准则) is likewise
    unrelated to either (HTML-sourced, Chinese-numeral "第X条" articles, no
    within-document tier split at all -- see tools/ingest/segment.py's CAS
    module comment) and gets its own third branch. Every other gaap's
    behavior (this function's pre-existing K-IFRS/US-GAAP path) is completely
    unchanged. VAS (Vietnamese Accounting Standards) gets its own fourth
    branch below -- HTML-sourced, plain digit "01."/table "| 01. |" đoạn
    numbering, at most one letter-numbered Phụ lục appendix per standard (see
    tools/ingest/segment.py's VAS module comment) -- chunked by
    `_chunk_region_vas` (not the shared `_chunk_region` every other gaap
    above uses), since VAS additionally needs the table-vs-list distinction
    and the cross-reference-line-wrap monotonic filter documented there.
